#  Bunk Buddy Tool

**"Njan ullappo enthina pedikunne? Attendance varum pokum…!"** 🎓  
*(Why fear when I'm here? Attendance comes and goes...!)*

**BunkBuddy** is a private attendance wingman built specifically for us and our friends. It helps you track your classes and plan your bunks smartly so you don't end up in the HOD's office.

### 🚀 Key Features

* **PDF Intelligence**: Directly reads our college attendance reports (even handles those "Attened" typos like a pro).
* **The "Raman Kutty" Alert**: If you're below the limit, it hits you with: *"Thalararuth Raman Kutty! Thalararuth!"* (Don't give up! Attend more classes).
* **The "Set Aanu" Pass**: When you're safe, it gives you the green light: *"Set aanu! Bunk and chill."* (All set! No scenes here).
* **Privacy-Centric**: No backend, no database. Your data stays in your browser—no "Pani Paali(Zone Out)" moments.
* **Theme Toggle**: Support for both **Light and Dark modes** to suit your mood.

### 🛠 Built With

* **Next.js 14/15**: For a fast, modern web experience.
* **Tailwind CSS**: For that clean, professional dashboard look.
* **PDF.js**: To parse and extract your report data locally.
* **Lucide React**: For beautiful, tech-focused icons.

### ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

This tool is a personal project for **private use among friends**. It is specifically designed to understand the table structure (Subject, Held, Attended, %) found in our specific college reports.

## 🧪 How to Test It

> **⚠️ Note:** This tool is strictly programmed for our college's specific PDF format.

If you want to test the UI/Vibe (and you aren't from my college), I have attached a **Sample Attendance Report** in this GitHub repository.

**Download it and upload it to the app to see the magic happen!**
